### Provisioning software defined storage infrastructure at cloud scale with Cisco Intersight Terraform provider 


#### Examples to show how to use the Cisco Intersight Terraform provider to automate zero touch infrastructure deployment required for a generic Cloud-Scale software defined storage on Cisco Unified Computing System(Cisco UCS). 


The deployment of the whole solution consists of several main steps:
1.	Create an account in Intersight and claim all storage nodes
2.	Create Terraform configuration environment for Intersight.
3.	Apply Terraform configurations for \
(A) Firmware Update on all storage nodes \
(B) Create server policies \
(C) Create server profiles \
(D) Deploy server profiles for all nodes \
(E) Install Operating System on nodes 
4.	Deploy software defined storage software
